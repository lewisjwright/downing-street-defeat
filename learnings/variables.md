# Variables

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "You are a secret agent breaking into number 10 to break up a party";
    std::cout << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Sneaky bastards! They've got code locks on the doors! You're going to need to break the codes...";

    // declare variables
    // int <- type of variable integer, string, float etc
    // declaring a variable = reserving space in memory
    // variables declared with values are initialised
    int a = 4;
    int b = 7;
    int c = 5;

    int sum = a + b + c;
    int product = a * b * c;

    std::cout << std::endl;
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    std::cout << product << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
